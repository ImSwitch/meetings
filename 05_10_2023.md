## Discussion

We start discussing the points of the document

- Jacopo: integration of PycroManager as an acquisition engine; some investigation is required in order to verify if sanning is possible (contact Henry/check documentation)
- Alessandro: we're also developing a tool for scanning acqusition with the ISM; we could think of integrating pieces of the BrightEyes-MCS into ImSwitch
- Jacopo: integrating Acquire 
- Jacopo: integrating Bluesky project as template interface
- Benedict: thinking back at a conference with Richard, a lot of projects are left unmantained after PhDs are over; we should strive to enhance what is already existing;
- Nils: this is our chance to have a good platform for smart microscopy workflows
- Jacopo: plugin system: this is __critical__ to make it more attractive to new users
- Jacopo: "Faster from idea to working prototype" - what is this exactly?
- Benedict: the idea is to make ImSwitch warm up faster, or whenever switching to a new configuration
- Nils: we already have a basic working structure for integrating napari plugins into ImSwitch; I also know a person who would be interested in working on this topic;
- Jacopo: human resources -> how many people do we hire? How much do we pay them? 2 devs or 1 dev + 1 project manager?
- Nils: also some money should be dedicated to workshops
- Benedict: a programmer in Germany at E13-3 takes around 70k €: 280k per 2 developers, two years; 40k € (10%) for workshops/travels; 80k € for a member of the overall research groups to guide the project development;
- Jacopo: how is this money received?
- Benedict: received quarterly in Nigeria;
- Jacopo: a possible plan -> 280k $ per 2 developers, two years; 40k $ for workshops/travels; 80k $ for a member of the overall research groups to guide the project development; total: 400k $
- Jacopo: to wrap up, I will send a new mail proposing a second monthly date dedicated only to discuss development topics.
