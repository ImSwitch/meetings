# Meeting notes 27 april 2023

Location: Jena, Germany

## Agenda:

- Using imswitch backend without the frontend
- Future imswitch
- Plugins
- Dirk shows test
- AOB

### Remotely controlling hardware using imswitch (Bene)

Bene wants to use the imswitch backend on an nvidia jetson, a small computer with limited computing resources. Due to the limited amounts of computational power, he cannot use imswitch or QT as it would be impossibly slow. To this end, he disabled the viewer but exposed all relevant features to a REST API. This can typically be done with the @APIexport decorator.

You can access the full json file at @bene  , please add
This file can be imported in swagger.io, and then immediately create new backends in many different languages.The cool thing is that now we can run everything on a web page.

It might be possible to make an imswitch that you could run locally, that then just controls the nvidia jetson, and streams the results. The question is if it would be fast enough, but Bene streams cameras regularly so it may be feasible.

At the moment, Bene does not intend to build that. He just uses the swagger app to create a web page with controls.

At the moment, this behaviour can be controlled by setting a global variable IS_HEADLESS, on bene’s branch.

Open questions:
Qt runs the threads and if we fully run it headless, how are threads going to work?
Future endeavours: Could we make the frontend modular?
Jacopo: That would probably require quite a large rewrite as the communication is done through Qt at the moment
Open question: How and if we are going to do that?


### Future imswitch

Xavier is finishing his PhD and we don’t know who else is maintaining it. Jacopo is also not sure. If we don’t have people who keep track of the structure, it may get too randomized and it will not be re-usable for other people.

Counting heads:

- Jacopo: You want to keep working on it and change parts of the architecture
- Bene wants to keep adding features
- Ondrej is happy to use it, and he would like to develop it further and also help guide it.
- David is undecided, he’s happy to be assigned to something. He’d like to develop some kind of plugins
- Undecided, mainly add devices
- Rainer wants to add Julia interface, not necessarily developing
- Dirk is leaving IPHT and is not sure if he can continue developing
- Jacopo says: Xavier is unsure if he can continue developing
- There are a few more people

### Funding

Bene: If we get a letter of intent from about 20 people we can probably get funding?
Jacopo: Maybe OME?

Bene: I talked to Xavier for quite a while. We could see if we can find a developer by obtaining funding. 
Jacopo has doubts about assigning a random person to do that and if we’re going to hire full time it should be someone from the imswitch community. He would not mind doing that.

Ondra: Innovation projects could be quite a good match as all departments could be supported and it would save a lot of time

To do:
Look at funding at the next meeting

Plugins
Bene: To make imswitch more maintainable, it would be nice to have a dummy class, and to have the actual implementation in a separate pip package. That would make it maybe easier to maintain. 
To do: talk to this on an architecture meeting

Dirk shows unittest

Next meeting:
We’ll have a meeting about funding in two weeks, on the 11th of May.

### AOB
There will be a napari workshop from sept 25 to 27 in Milan.
Bene: You can now control serial ports through a browser. See youseetoo.github.io/indexWebSerialTest.html for an example.
Let’s apply here: https://aspp.school/wiki/applications
