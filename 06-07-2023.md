## Notes

Henry: focus on the strong points of ImSwitch
- reconfigurability
- having this enforces the idea of joining in
- very nice front-end
- working in cohesion with Pycro-Manager API
- the success of Micro-Manager is mostly due to the C++ core

Max:
- what does Micro-Manager do? It is a core containing all the devices

Jacopo:
- it covers not only that; it's a Fiji plugin with its own GUI

Henry:
- giving a description of the Pycro-Manager GUI

Benedict:
- what would be the best idea to integrate Micro-Manager into ImSwitch?
- funding situation is currently a bit blocked

Henry:
- integrate Pycro-Manager rather than pymmcore
- using the core API allows to control the devices at a low level
- Pycro-Manager also provides support for the Acquisition engine
- this is a fast acquisition engine that writes NDTiffs

Jacopo
- would multi-camera work?

Henry
- unfortunately no at the moment; you could spawn different cores (not much of memory consumption)

Francisco joins
- I would like to replace LabView with another type of way to control an FPGA
- a lot of people working on MINFLUX are fragmented, would be great to converge all work into a single solution

Henry:
- MicroFPGA works with Micro-Manager 

Jacopo
- PYNQ is becoming a big thing

Henry:
- what are the key points?

Jacopo
- 1: integrating Pycro-Manager rather than pymmcore-plus (ask Henry on github);
- 2: licensing (still don't know what the situation is);
- 3: documentation (I'm trying to enforce it more);
- 4: funding (we still need to keep looking for funding or people who are already funded. Lucien has some funding and interest in using ImSwitch for smart microscopy)
